# Hello World
This is my first GitHub project which will be a simple "Hello World". I am currently taking a course on programming and hopefully will learn much more!

## Project Description 

In this project, I: - Created a GitHub repository to understand how version control works. - Used GitHub Codespaces for editing and writing the HTML code for the webpage. - Explored basic HTML and CSS to style the webpage. - Published the webpage using GitHub Pages to understand web hosting. 

## Files in the Repository 

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the "Hello World" webpage. It contains the structure and content of the webpage. 
- `README.md`: This file, providing details about the project and the learning process. 

## View the Webpage You can view the webpage I created at `https://<rleyba19>.github.io/<helloworld>/`.

## Questions or Issues If you have any questions about my project or encounter any issues, please open an issue in this repository, and I'll look into it as soon as possible. 

Thank you for checking out my first GitHub project!
